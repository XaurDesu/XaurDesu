### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jaime Torres, currently a Computer Engineering student at Universidad de los Andes in Colombia; My interests (when talking about Software, of course) include Robotics, game engines, compilers and basically anything Open Source related. Might dabble in projects here and there, you guys know how it is. My commit history is a bit spotty, just keep in mind i'm a student, i can't contribute to stuff all day, even if i wanted to.

He/Him

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my undergrad, but besides that i've comitted to a few repos for Open Source software, once i'm more "established" in some communities, i will put it here. (something something i like programming languages.)
