I'm Jaime Torres, currently a Computer Engineering student at Universidad de los Andes in Colombia; My interests (when talking about Software, of course) include Robotics, game engines, compilers and basically anything Open Source related. Might dabble in projects here and there, you guys know how it is. He/Him
